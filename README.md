# Crowdfunding-ETL
## See challenge folder for all deliverables 

### Purpose
Independent Funding, a fictional crowdfunding company, has kept all of their campaign data in one excel file. We were hired to perform an ETL proccess on the data to extract data from the excel file using python, transform the data into smaller tables connected by foreign keys, and load the newly created tables into a SQL database.
